            <h1>Hi, there!</h1>
            <div class="content-box">
                 <p class="contents">I'm <strong>Naphz</strong>, or people usually called me Billy. I'm currently
                preparing to take my Information Systems major at Binus University Jakarta. Hopefully this year!
                In the meantime, I'm keeping myself busy by self-studying and have taken some commissioned freelance work.<br><br>

                Long story short, I have been liked into drawing and building pieces of stuff since when I was like 6 or 7. I also have attended
                numerous drawing competitions while I was in kindergarten until middle-high school. In 2011, I've dived into GFX Community on Facebook and from that, I've successfully taught myself to use my current primary software called Adobe Photoshop. Until 2015, I decided to start focusing
                on digital drawing, this is the time where my penname <strong>naphnaphz</strong> was born. Also during this time, I've met various creative-like talents
                that have encouraged me to keep striving and get better with art!
                At the late of 2018, I've hooked myself with coding and started taught myself to write my website from scratch HTML CSS and I even have a bot that is currently serving an art community on Discord! As of this year 2020, It's no different and I'm still thirsty to learn something new!<br><br>

                If you have any business inquiries that would like to discuss, feel free to reach me out on social media or slide into my email below. x)
